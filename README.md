# address-bloc-actual


This is an address book command line application built using Express, Node, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, and Inquirer.  First fork and clone the application to your local machine.  Install dependencies by running npm i.  Additionally install sequelize-cli from npm.  Type: "npm i --save sequelize-cli@5.4.0".  Set up your postgreSQL database to match the database name in the config file (db/config/config.json).  Run the migrations using the sequelize CLI (sequelize db:migrate && sequelize db:migrate --env test).  Then type node index.js to run the application in your shell.  You can add contacts, see a list of all contacts, search for existing contacts, and delete contacts.
